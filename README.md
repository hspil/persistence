# persistence
A collection of java programs to calculate multiplicative persistence.
They use the ArbitraryInteger class which I made and can be found here: https://github.com/kalebvonburris/ArbitraryInteger.

See the Numberphile video for background on multiplicative persistence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wim9WJeDTHQ
